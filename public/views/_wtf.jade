	h3 Ummmm.... WTF!?!?
	P You're Listening to the Farts of the World. If anyone on Twitter mentions the word "Fart", this website will pull in the tweet (real time) and play a fart noise.
	p If you're only interested in listening to your own farts, just <a data-toggle='modal' href='#sign_in'>go here</a> and tweet something about farts.
	p Anyone can specify the type of fart they'd like to hear by adding ONE of the following hash tags.
